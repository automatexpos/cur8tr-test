# Email Configuration Setup

## Gmail SMTP Setup Instructions

To enable email verification for user registration, you need to set up Gmail SMTP with the following steps:

### 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail

1. Go to your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click on "2-Step Verification"
4. Follow the steps to enable 2-factor authentication if not already enabled

### 2. Generate App Password

1. Still in the Security section, look for "App passwords" (this option only appears if 2-Step Verification is enabled)
2. Click on "App passwords"
3. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other (Custom name)" as the device
4. Enter "Cur8tr App" as the device name
5. Click "Generate"
6. Copy the 16-character password that appears (this is your APP_PASSWORD)

### 3. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (or set these in your deployment platform):

```env
APP_EMAIL=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com
```

### 4. Important Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control
- The APP_PASSWORD is different from your regular Gmail password
- Use the 16-character app password generated by Google
- Keep your credentials secure and don't share them

### 5. Testing

You can test the email functionality by:

1. Starting your Flask application with the environment variables set
2. Attempting to register a new user
3. Checking if the verification email is received

### 6. Deployment Considerations

For production deployments:

- Set environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, Heroku, etc.)
- Consider using environment-specific email addresses
- Monitor email sending logs for any issues

### 7. Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **"Username and password not accepted"**: Make sure you're using the app password, not your regular Gmail password
- **Connection timeout**: Check if your server/hosting provider blocks SMTP connections
- **Email not received**: Check spam folder, verify email address is correct
- **2FA not enabled**: App passwords only work when 2-factor authentication is enabled

### 8. Alternative Email Providers

If you prefer not to use Gmail, you can modify the SMTP settings in `utils.py`:

- **Outlook/Hotmail**: `smtp.live.com`, port 587
- **Yahoo**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com`, port 587
- **Custom SMTP**: Update the smtp_server and smtp_port variables

The current implementation is optimized for Gmail but can be easily adapted for other providers.
